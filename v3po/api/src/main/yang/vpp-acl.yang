        ACL lists are merged into 3 type of acls (l2, ip4 and ip6) that are supported by vpp.
        Then 3 corresponding chains of tables and sessions are created and assigned to the interface
        as l2, ip4 and ip6 classify table chains.
        User ordering is preserved in each group separately.

        Assignment update/delete removes all created tables and sessions and repeats process described above.
        Update/delete of ACL lists referenced here is not permitted (assignment needs to be removed first).

        Read is supported only for acls that were created and assigned by Honeycomb agent
        (corresponding metadata are present).

        Limitations (due to vpp limitations):
        - egress rules are currently ignored (HONEYCOMB-234)
        - L4 rules are currently not supported (limited support will by provided by HONEYCOMB-218)
        - mixing L2/L3/L4 rules is currently not supported (limited support will by provided by HONEYCOMB-233)
        - L2 only rules on L3 interfaces are not supported (not allowed by vpp,
          in the future defining L2/L3 pairs should be partially supported)
